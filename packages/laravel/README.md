# inertia-prime/laravel

Laravel companion package for **Inertia Prime**, a React component library
purpose-built for Laravel + Inertia.js applications.

> This package currently contains only stubs and placeholders. The concrete
> implementation of helpers and commands will be added in a future phase.

## Installation

```bash
composer require inertia-prime/laravel
```

Laravel will auto-discover the `InertiaPrime\\InertiaPrimeServiceProvider`.

## Features (planned)

- Request helpers for parsing table filters, sorting, and pagination.
- Response formatting for server-driven tables.
- Toast notification helpers for Inertia responses.
- Artisan commands to scaffold table classes and install configuration.

For more details, see the root `README.md` and `apps/docs` Laravel section.
