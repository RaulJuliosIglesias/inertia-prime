# @inertia-prime/react

React components and hooks designed specifically for **Laravel + Inertia.js**.

> This package currently exposes only placeholders and no runtime-ready components.
> Implementation will be added in future iterations.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @inertia-prime/react @inertiajs/react react react-dom
# or
pnpm add @inertia-prime/react @inertiajs/react react react-dom
```

## Usage

> [TODO] Document concrete usage once components and hooks are implemented.

For now, see the root `README.md` and `apps/docs` for conceptual examples and API plans.
