# CRUD Table Example

> [TODO] Fill in concrete code once DataTable and Laravel helpers are implemented.

This example will show:

- A `UserController` using `TableBuilder` and `HandlesTableRequests`.
- An Inertia React page using `useInertiaTable` and `DataTable`.
- Common filters (search, status, date range).
- Bulk delete and export actions.
