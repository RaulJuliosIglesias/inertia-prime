# Laravel Installation

Install the backend package:

```bash
composer require inertia-prime/laravel
```

Laravel's package auto-discovery will register the service provider. If you
prefer manual registration:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    InertiaPrime\\InertiaPrimeServiceProvider::class,
],
```

> [TODO] Document configuration options in `config/inertia-prime.php` once
> they are finalized.
