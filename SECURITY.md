# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Inertia Prime is in early development. Until a **1.0** release is tagged, support guarantees are best-effort only.

Once 1.0 is released, we aim to:

- Support the latest **minor** release line.
- Backport critical security fixes when feasible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Inertia Prime (React package, Laravel package, or documentation site infrastructure):

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Instead, contact the maintainers directly:
   - [TODO: add security contact email]
3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - Affected package(s) and versions
   - Reproduction steps
   - Potential impact
   - Any proposed mitigations

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as possible.
- Investigate the issue and determine its impact.
- Work on a fix and coordinate a release.
- Credit you in the release notes if you wish.

## Public Disclosure

Please give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before any public disclosure.

If you believe we have not responded adequately to your report, you may choose responsible public disclosure, but we request that you:

- Avoid sharing exploit details that make it trivial to weaponize the vulnerability.
- Clearly state that you attempted private disclosure first.

Thank you for helping keep the Laravel + Inertia ecosystem safe.
